- drop duplicates
- graph comparing  df vs df_noDuplicates 
- visual summary of df_noDuplicates

- Log Transform every suitable feature
- graph comparing df_noDuplicates before and after log transformation

 (keeping both graphs or deleting one)
- displaying Statistical the relevant features

- transforming data and storing in data_transformed

- normalizing ---- look at it. Falsch initialisiert/unterschiedlich(?)

- Statistical view Correlation between all feature to quality
- visualisation view Correlation between all feature to quality x2


- unsupervised Clustering
- kmeans visualized with all features
- PCA to visualise kmeans
- cluster visualised & heatmap
- crosstab of cluster
